# Abuse Policy
StarCat Brands has a clear [:octicons-law-24: Terms of Service](terms_of_service.md) and [:octicons-no-entry-24: Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable_use_policy.md). These establish and clarify how our services can and cannot be used. Nobody likes reading this kind of stuff, but it helps to explain what we mean by “abuse”.

## Reporting abuse
Please immediately contact `report@starcatbrands.com` to report any kind of abuse related to StarCat Brands, our services, or our members, **except** for DMCA/Copyright Infringement reports.

Please report **DMCA** or **Copyright Infringement** Claims as specified in our [:material-file-document-alert-outline: DMCA Policy](dmca_policy.md).

## How we handle abuse reports
When we receive a report of abuse, we investigate promptly and thoroughly. We want to address the issue fairly, and we strive to balance privacy and safety for all those involved.

While some violations are flatly obvious, others are subjective, nuanced, and difficult to adjudicate. We give each case adequate time and attention, commensurate with the violation, criticality, and severity of the charge.

We will terminate an account without advance notice if there is evidence it is being used for a restricted purpose that has, is, or will cause severe harm. If applicable, we will also report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

For other cases, we’ll take a case-by-case approach to clear things up.

Further, as a small, privately owned independent business that puts our values and conscience ahead of growth at all costs, we reserve the right to deny service to anyone we ultimately feel uncomfortable doing business with.

### Can you appeal a decision?
If we terminate an account without notice, the decision is final.

For other cases, we will consider good faith appeals sent to `appeals@starcatbrands.com` by the account owner within 14 calendar days.
