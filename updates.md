# Updates
Want to receive notifications whenever we make changes to any of these policies? We've posted these policies in their own repository on GitHub so that you can "watch" for any changes, and GitHub will send you a notification.

Here's how you can do this:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign in with your account. You can create a free account if you don't have one.
2. Visit our `service-policies` repository at [https://github.com/starcatbrands/service-policies](https://github.com/starcatbrands/service-policies).
3. Click the "Watch" button at the top right corner of the page.
4. Choose the notification settings you want. If you want to keep things simple, just select "All Activity."

That's it! You'll get notifications for any activity that happens in that repository. You can change your notification settings or stop getting notifications by clicking the "Watch" button again.

!!! example "Hey, this gif says Basecamp!"
    For the purpose of getting this page up and running, we've unabashedly stolen this handy gif from Basecamp's [policies repo](https://github.com/basecamp/policies/blob/master/updates/how-to-enable-notifications.gif). (Thanks, Basecamp!)

    We'll get our own fancy gif built and posted, post-haste!
